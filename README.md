Health and beyond is a website by Global IE. 
The website aims to help women in the age of 50 - 65 develop better eating habits. We wish to support them in this journey through our 3-step program. The 3-step program helps them analyse their diet, receive recommendations on what to eat and locate places where they can find ingredients for the food we recommend.
